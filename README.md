# HTML
* Stands for <b>Hyper text markup language</b>
* HTML = giving instructions to a computer
* HTML Elements - buttons, paragraph tag, etc. - Anything that can be displayed on the webpage. Every element consists of two HTML Tags.
* HTML Tag = <button> is a tag = tells the computer what we're trying to create. 
* HTML Attribute = modifies how an element behaves.

* Extra spaces are ignored in HTML display text. So, for  number of spaces between words > 1 or new lines will still be displayed with a single space -- doesn't matter.
