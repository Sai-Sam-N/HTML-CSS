    <p>Hello, World!</p>
    <p>Date : 12 Jan 2025. I woke up early today - 9AM, it is pretty early considering the fact that I slept at 2.30AM. I read a news that baffled me - a government employee forcefully married to another women, in Bihar, who were allegedly in a relationship for 4 years. The guy thankfully ran away and the girl - Gunjan - went to his home and was not accepted by his parents. Apparenly such "forceful marriages" are pretty common in the Bihar and other states, with the maximum cases in 2024. What is wrong with people?</p>
